## Ho to layout the paths
### Paths from bot-bases:
- each team needs a separated short path with only the Base-objective
- the paths from the base should just lead to any of the flags. From there they will continue on searching for their objectives
#### Paths from flags
- there should be a path to every of the other flags from one flag
- on path can link several or even all flags
- each flag a path connects has to be on the objectives of the paths
#### Paths at flags
- should run in the radius of the flag most of the time
- should only have one objective on them

## Other stuff
- Ask before you do too much and its not working ;-)
- Naming of objectives (all without "):
	- Bases: "base us" / "base ru"
	- Flags: "A", "B", "C",..
